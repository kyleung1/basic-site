<p> This is a picture of me. I made this website using the
    <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> framework. I started making this website as a
    personal project back in the summer of 2021 and recently finished it in December of 2021. The purpose of this
    project was to learn Django, Python, Html, and the web development process in general while making something
    that I will be using frequently.
